    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores.

    "**Answer: **<br>\n",
    "<b>Model 1: Support Vector Machines</b><br>\n",
    "a) SVM can be used for face recognition, classification of images, handwriting recognition and bioinformatics. <br>https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/<br><br>\n",
    "b) It works well for high dimensional data. It is memory efficient. It handles non-linear data efficiently. It has stability i.e. small change to data doesn't affect the model massively.<br> \n",
    "http://theprofessionalspoint.blogspot.com/2019/03/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-svm.html <br><br>\n",
    "c) Choosing an appropriate kernel function is not easy. Training data can take long time for large amount of data. <br> https://statinfer.com/204-6-8-svm-advantages-disadvantages-applications/\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "d) We will use SVM to classify the given data as they are straight-forward to use and also work really work in high dimensions. As we have also scaled and one-hot-encoded the data, it shall be convenient to use the SVM algorithm.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Model 2: KNN</b><br>\n",
    "a) This algorithm can be used to recommend similar items to users and to make a recommendation system. <br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-industry-applications-of-the-K-nearest-neighbor-algorithm<br><br>\n",
    "b) This is a very easy to use, quick and efficient algorithm. It has no training involved. It is also really easy to explain and is interpretable. It also handles multi-class classification in a very intuitive and simple way. <br> https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/ http://www2.cs.man.ac.uk/~raym8/comp37212/main/node264.html<br><br> c) It is too simple an algorithm and requires a lot of representative data when there are several classes. Also if the data has imbalanced classes(data is skewed) it will really hamper the working of this algorithm. Also data must be stored as it doesnt really 'learn' from data. SO all the training data must be stored when working with test data. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm<br><br> d) As the data has unbalanced classes, I probably shouldn't be using this algorithm, but again I really want to try it out. Also it will save me time in computing as the data is pretty large and algorithms like SVM may take time to learn and predict. <br><br> <b>Model 3 : Logistic Regression </b><br>\n",
    "a) It is used for prediction where the answer will be in discrete form. (Yes/No). Predicting the weather, Diagnosing someone as healthy or sick. <br> https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-real-life-examples-of-logistic-regression<br><br>\n",
    "b) It is a widely used technique because it is very efficient, does not require too many computational resources, it’s highly interpretable, it doesn’t require input features to be scaled, it doesn’t require any tuning, it’s easy to regularize, and it outputs well-calibrated predicted probabilities. <br> https://machinelearning-blog.com/2018/04/23/logistic-regression-101/<br><br> \n",
    "c) It fails to identify independent variables. It can only produce discrete outcomes and not continuous outcomes. logit models are vulnerable to overfitting. <br> https://www.theclassroom.com/disadvantages-logistic-regression-8574447.html<br><br>\n",
    "d) Since we have to classify a person as someone who will donate or not, and logistic regression returns discrete values, it makes a strong case for suitable model. I really wish to try it out as I haven't used it before. "

    "**Answer: ** <br>We used three machine learning algorithms : Logistic Regression, KNN and Support vector machine. We observed that the most time time was taken by SVM (during training on 100% of training data) and K-Nearest Neighbors (during testing). The least amount of time, to train and test both, was taken by the Logistic Regression.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "All the algorithms are suitable for this problem. If we were to choose the most suitable ones, then they would be SVM and Logistic Regressiom because of their properties which have been mentioned above. K-Nearest Neighbours is affected by unbalanced classes and that is the case here.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, the most important factor to choose our model would be the metric we used to score their performances, F-score. The F-score tells how good the model performed on the test set. It's the harmonic mean of precision and recall which are two different metrics. The higher the F-score the better the model is. We saw that Logistic Regression outperformed both the other algorithms when 100% of the training data was used. \n",

That answer may be Yes/No, Pass/Fail or in this case, it will be whether a person will donate or not. \n",
    "<br> <br>It takes such factors, does some mathematical work (i.e. considers the probability of that factor being true or false, or belonging to a particular category) and plots them on a sigmoid function graph, and returns answer as 0 or 1 very 1 may be assigned the positive result and 0 the negative result. Take for example, Spam detection is a classification problem where we are given an email and we need to classify whether or not it is spam. If the email is spam, we label it 1; if it is not spam, we label it 0. In order to apply Logistic Regression to the spam detection problem, the following features of the email are extracted:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>Sender of the email\n",
    "<br>Number of typos in the email\n",
    "<br>Occurrence of words/phrases like “offer”, “prize”, “free gift”, etc.\n",
    "<br><br>The resulting feature vector is then used to train a Logistic classifier which emits a score in the range 0 to 1. If the score is more than 0.5, we label the email as spam. Otherwise, we don’t label it as spam.\n",
    "<br><br> It is a simple mathematical model. \n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

    "It may serve importance as it can determine or help predict the future asset value of a person and how much they're destined to grow. Hours-per-week is most probably the amount of a time a person spends doing work and this is directly related to the earnings of a person. For a businessperson or a salesperson, more hours in a week generally directly relate to more profits or more comission. Also, as a person gets to snior level positions, more work is expected out of them and so they need to devote even more time to their work. Thus more time is proportional to more work which is proportional to higher position and thus , higher income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
